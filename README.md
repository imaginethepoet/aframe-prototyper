# a-frame-prototyper
This is a simple project designed to help rapidly prototype mixed experiences using a-frame as a base.
The goal is to quickly help someone with a vive, google cardboard, hololens understand the components that
make up a 3D and multi-dimensional experience.

I've included a few items and textures to just quickly show you how fast you can change out the enviornment.
Better documentation coming as evolve this.


This version has been upgraded to support the 3D.io rooms application framework
This is a single room implementation

Using magic voxel you can do some really great quick simple 3d models and get a good sense of your enviornments and scenes.



1. You will need to run NPM Install this gets all the goodies
2. You will need a WEB Vr browser to use this Firefox Nightly /  Chrome With WebVR Enabled
3. This is based on the awesome a-frame framework
4. Look in index.html and you will see more information and commented section.
